# Managing Earthquakes Better with AI

### Introduction
As an engineer I have always been pasionate about using tehcnology to improve human lives. When I started my first formal Data Science course I decided to work on a capstone porject that can show how powerful AI is and how we can use it solve real world issues. 
Being a resident of British Columbia I know that British Columbia lies on biggest fault line in Canada and there is a constant threat of a major earthquake that can hit this piece of land anytime. This was where my motivation came from. I decided to work on a project which could detect early earthquakes and predict high pressure waves a little before time. More work can be done on this project to predcit earthquakes well before time and take all precautinary measures to minimize life and property losses.

### Dataset
I got access to open source data of 3-component siesmograms labelled as noise and earthquake from different parts of the world. 
Data can be found here:
